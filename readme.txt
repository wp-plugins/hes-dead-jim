Like "Hello Dolly" from Matt, "He's Dead, Him" produces random lines from Star Trek: The Original Series.

== Description ==

Do you like the idea behind Matt's "Hello, Dolly" plugin, but feel that it doesn't feed your inner nerd? Then here's "He's Dead, Jim" which has been shamelessly ported from Matt's plugin. The concept is the same, except that instead of lines from "Hello, Dolly" you get lines from Star Trek: The Original Series. There are no settings, just install it, activate it, and enjoy.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hes-dead-jim` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if "Hello Dolly" is still activated? =

Normally, "He's Dead, Jim" will output its text where "Hello Dolly" does. If "Hello Dolly" is activated, "He's Dead Jim" will output its text *underneath* the "Screen Options" and "Help" tabs.

== Screenshots ==

1. "He's Dead, Jim" in action. 
2. Appearance when "Hello Dolly" is activated.
